## Quickstart

### 1. Clone the repository and install with npm
```bash
$ cd my-folder/
$ git clone https://github.com/IdeaLabDigital/Starter.git
$ cd Starter
$ npm install
```

### 2. While you're working on your project, run:

```bash
$ npm run watch
```

If you want to take advantage of browser-sync (automatic browser refresh when a file is saved), simply open your Gulpfile.js and put your local dev-server address (e.g localhost) in this field ```var URL = '';``` , save the Gulpfile and run
```bash
$ npm run watch
```

### 3. For building all the assets, run:

```bash
$ npm run build
```

Build all assets minified and without sourcemaps:
```bash
$ npm run production
```

### Styles

Please note that you **must** run `npm run build` or `npm run watch` in your terminal for the styles to be copied and concatenated.

Once you have installed the packages, you can check your entire theme by running:
```bash
$ npm run phpcs
```

If there are errors that Code Sniffer can fix automatically, run the following command to fix them:
```bash
$ npm run phpcbf
```
